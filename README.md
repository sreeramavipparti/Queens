Chess Queens problem written in C Initially Started in Sep, 2017 after seeing a news in a local telugu daily. There are many ways to program 8-queens problem. Tried to simplify a solution. Only others programmers who study this, if interested, can give their feedback.

Tested for doubly even numbers, singly even numbers, odd numbers divisible by 3 and other odd numbers. See Queens.h for the logic adopted(?!).
